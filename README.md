# Facial-Expression-Recognition
Facial Expression Recognition using custom data set of 7 emotions, labelled, into train and test, using CNN in Keras.

Follow the [.ipynb notebook](https://github.com/abhisheknr0411/Facial-Expression-Recognition/blob/master/Facial_Expression_Training.ipynb) inside the repository for stepwise instructions for facial recognition.
This Project is still **incomplete** so as to accomodate a WebApp or a GUI for uploading images/videos to run the model with a comfortable interface.(Hence the conversion of the model into a .json  file)

**Quick Note**: I could not upload the data set. Hence, I'm providing you the data for .zip files for [Train](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gnuuJKJg2SVjT2cjosLugF9Jwy6YZ_ji/view?usp=sharing) and [Test](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19zjWVrJNf13mCKVlZGV8J_pk9tCbShk4/view?usp=sharing) Data as is so that you'll be able to unzip and use it as it is. 
**Thank you**
