# Facial-Expression-Recognition
Facial Expression Recognition using custom data set of 7 emotions, labelled, into train and test, using CNN in Keras.

Follow the .ipynb notebook inside the repository for stepwise instructions for facial recognition.
This Project is still **incomplete** so as to accomodate a WebApp or a GUI for uploading images/videos to run the model with a comfortable interface.(Hence the conversion of the model into a .json  file)

**Thank you**
